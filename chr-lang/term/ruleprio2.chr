-- Choose deterministically, without backtracking, the highest rule prio amongst same matches
-- Here: rule 'f', fails (no backtracking so indeed no solutions).
-- The example also demonstrates that (inherited/current) backtrack prio 'p' can be referred to in rule prio
(p,p) :: three @ P 1 <=> P 3.
(p,p+1) :: two @ P 1 <=> P 2.
(p,p+2) :: f @ P 1 <=> Fail.
